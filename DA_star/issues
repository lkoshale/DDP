1. what's the Hx value for the unreachable node from destianantio  before inserts.
2. propogate to unreachable node to find the path or do A* and add to PQ.
3. parallel merge ( deletions are -1nad next  )

4. while deletion match the weight for : del then re-insert, also insert first or del first.// multi edges
5. we dont support deletion of edges inserted in updates in same cycle

6. need to do A* after del , as what if thereone parent which is not visited and INT_MAX propoggates in the optimal path.
 - when to do the A*
    - if the edge from optimal path gets deleted and there are nodes with lesser cost than destination in openList.


#### add new property
1.deleting edges not the parent doesn't change the cost
2. delting edges not in optimal path doesnt change the optimal path // no need to do A*


######## deletion before insertion bug ########
1.  a node u value gets increased due to deletion.
2. a node v in subgraph of it tries to add edge v -> u. the cost of v is less do its added now we have a parent cycle as
cost of v is based on cost of u. 


###############
single iteration of Deletion taking more time than doing A* whole from begining.
